# Veil of Aether

## About
*The Veil of Aether* is a free and open-source (FOSS) action-adventure RPG. It is based in the fictional land of Neyvara, a world focused on the four elements of Earth, Fire, Wind, and Water. The protagonist of the game is Darian (the player), a young adult who sets out on an epic adventure to save the world from an evil sorcerer. He must fight through trials and dungeons to reach the final climactic battle.

This repository contains concept art for in-game enemies, characters, structures, and more.
